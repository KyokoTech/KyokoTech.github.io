				<h1>Our Process</h1>
				<p>At Kyoko Technologies, we believe in a collaborative approach that ensures your vision is brought to
					life efficiently and effectively.</p>

				<h3>Here's how we turn your ideas into a working reality:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Free Consultation: Understanding Your Needs</strong>
						<p><i>We start with a conversation.</i></p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Initial Meeting:</strong> Our team will meet with you to understand your vision,
								goals,
								and
								requirements.
								This consultation is free of charge.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Needs Assessment:</strong> We'll dive deep into what you want to achieve,
								discussing specific
								features,
								user experience, and potential challenges.</li>
							<li><strong>Solution Outline:</strong> Together, we will outline the Minimum Viable Product
								(MVP) that will
								serve as
								the foundation for your project.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Development Phase: Building Your MVP</strong>
						<p><i>Watch your idea come to life.</i></p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>MVP Agreement:</strong> Once we finalize the MVP details, our skilled developers
								will begin
								crafting your
								application.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Bi-Weekly Updates:</strong> Throughout the development process, you'll receive
								bi-weekly updates
								on our
								progress, including demonstrations of new features and the opportunity for feedback.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Our team conducts thorough testing to ensure your
								MVP is not just
								functional,
								but
								also robust and user-friendly.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Iterative Improvement: Enhancing Your Solution</strong>
						<p><i>We don't stop at the launch.</i></p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Live MVP:</strong> Once your MVP is live, we continue to work with you to
								iterate and improve based on
								user
								feedback and performance metrics.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Ongoing Support:</strong> Throughout the development process, you'll receive
								bi-weekly updates
								on our
								progress, including demonstrations of new features and the opportunity for feedback.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Design and Brand Enhancement:</strong> We are partnered with a professional
								design team
								allowing us to elevate the visual appeal of your application. We can refine user
								interfaces, enhance branding, and implement modern design trends to ensure your product
								not only functions well but also captivates users with its aesthetic appeal.
							</li>

						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h1>Pricing Structure</h1>
				<h3>We believe in transparency when it comes to pricing:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Free Consultation:</strong> Start here, no cost to you.</li>
					<li><strong>Upfront Payment:</strong> Our pricing starts with an upfront payment that covers initial
						implementation and
						infrastructure costs. The total amount will depend on the complexity of the solution being
						developed.</li>
					<li><strong>Monthly Charges:</strong> After the MVP is live, we will forward monthly infrastructure
						costs and charges to
						you,
						allowing for ongoing support and scalability.</li>
					<li><strong>Profit Sharing Option:</strong> For clients with limited funding options, we offer the
						opportunity to work
						out a
						profit-sharing agreement. This arrangement will last for as long as we continue to support the
						project,
						aligning our success with yours.
					<li><strong>Handoff Costs:</strong> When you decide to take full ownership of your project, we will
						facilitate a smooth
						transition. There is a cost associated with the handoff, which covers the time and resources
						needed
						to
						train your new team and ensure they are well-equipped to manage the project independently.</li>
				</ul>
