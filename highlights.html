				<p>At Kyoko Technologies, we believe the best way to showcase what we can do is through the work we've
					already delivered. From AI-powered applications to rapid MVP launches, we've helped clients bring
					their ideas to life with speed and precision. Here are some of the projects we're proud to have
					worked on.

				<h4>Create Your Own Coloring Books</h4>
				<p><span class="image right"><a href="https://kyoko.ink" target="_blank"><img
								src="images/colorbykyoko.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
					Color by Kyoko is one of our flagship projects, developed entirely in-house by our expert team. It's
					a unique platform that allows users to create custom coloring books and share them with a vibrant
					community. From concept to execution, we built Color by Kyoko from the ground up, showcasing our
					ability to quickly deliver fully customized solutions that are both powerful and user-friendly.</p>
				<h3>Here's a peek under the hood of how it all comes together:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Hosted on AWS:</strong> We chose AWS for its scalability and reliability, ensuring the
						platform runs
						smoothly, no matter how many users are coloring or creating. AWS also allows us to easily scale
						as demand grows, keeping performance high and downtime low.</li>
					<li><strong>Stripe for Payments:</strong> To handle secure transactions, we integrated Stripe as our
						payment
						processor. Users can purchase tokens through the platform, allowing them to unlock special
						features and create their own custom stories, all while enjoying a seamless and secure payment
						experience.</li>
					<li><strong>AI-Powered Customization:</strong> Leveraging our expertise in AI, Color by Kyoko
						includes cutting-edge
						AI tools that help users generate unique designs and patterns, making every coloring book a
						personalized masterpiece.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Color by Kyoko reflects the same speed and customization we offer to all our clients, demonstrating
					the
					full range of what we can build and integrateâ€”from hosting and payments to AI-driven featuresâ€”all in
					one
					powerful, creative platform.

					The Pearl is a groundbreaking mental health app that we helped bring to life, working closely with
					our client to deliver a functional MVP in record time. Designed to provide users with an accessible
					mental health navigator at their fingertips, The Pearl offers real-time support and guidance, all

					Our team took the project from concept to a fully working MVP, which we then handed off to the
					client to continue developing independently. Today, the project has grown, with a dedicated team of
					over 10 people driving its evolution.

				<h3>Key Features of The Pearl:</h3>
